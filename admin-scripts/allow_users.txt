# Some rules:
#   Each users in each line.
#   '#' means this line this disabled, as it is the comment, no matter where the '#' in the line. E.g.
#     #admin@local -> Disabled
#     admin@local# -> Disabled
#   No empty lines. It will return the very weird behaviour (thanks Python Foundation)
#   root user is not allowed
administrator
